The goal of this project is to collect data including sightings of coyotes and red foxes in Wichita, KS.
These sightings will be reported by the general public.
I will collect, clean, and perform exploratory analyses on this data.

There is a sighting form found at https://arcg.is/00Omra
The data collected from this will be put into a spreadsheet called wichita_sighting_data_original.csv which will be made read-only
The cleaned data will be put into a spreadsheet called wichita_sightings_data_cleaned.csv
Both will be in the data folder.

The docs folder will contain any documents I deem necessary for the project. Since these may be Word documents, these will be ignored.

The code folder will contain any code. TBD

The figures folder will contain any figures made in the process. Since these will be images, they will be ignored by git.
